# Task: Add Comprehensive README.md

## Status: in_progress

## Description
Create a high-quality `README.md` that serves as the entry point for the Senechal Gateway project. It should bridge the gap between technical specs and the user guide, highlighting the project's unique value propositions (polyglot plugins, reliability, security).

## TODO
- [x] Create branch `gemini/add-readme`
- [x] Create Kanban card
- [ ] Draft `README.md` content
- [ ] Review and refine content
- [ ] Commit and push to branch

## Context
The project currently has deep technical docs (`SPEC.md`, `MVP.md`, `RFCs`) and a detailed `USER_GUIDE.md`, but lacks a welcoming, high-level summary at the root.
