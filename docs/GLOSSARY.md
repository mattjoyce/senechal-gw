# Ductile Glossary

Key terms used throughout Ductile's documentation and configuration.

---

## Gateway

The `ductile` binary — the central runtime that manages plugins, schedules work, routes events, and maintains the execution ledger.

## Plugin / Connector

A polyglot adapter that connects Ductile to an external system (an API, a database, a shell command). Written in any language; communicates via JSON over stdin/stdout. 
- **Plugin:** The code and manifest (the implementation).
- **Connector:** The logical integration point (the "skill").

## Alias (Plugin Instance)

A uniquely named and configured instance of a base plugin. Defined in `plugins.yaml` using the `uses:` field. Allows running multiple copies of the same logic (e.g., `discord_alerts` vs `discord_logs`) with different settings.

## Command

A discrete operation provided by a plugin. Common commands include:

- **`poll`** — proactive; Ductile calls the plugin on a schedule to pull data.
- **`handle`** — reactive; the plugin processes an incoming event.
- **`health`** — diagnostic; verifies the plugin's prerequisites are met.
- **`init`** — one-time setup; runs when a plugin is first registered.

## Pipeline

A high-level workflow orchestration defined in YAML. Pipelines react to a single trigger event and execute a sequence of plugin steps, automatically passing data between them.

## Event Bus

The internal routing layer that decouples producers (schedules, webhooks, API) from consumers (pipelines, plugins). It ensures events are distributed to all matching routes.

## Event

A typed packet of data (e.g., `youtube.playlist_item`) that signals an occurrence and triggers routing within the gateway.

## Payload

The JSON object attached to an event. Payload fields are passed to downstream plugins when the event is routed.

## Context (Baggage)

Immutable metadata (e.g., `origin_user_id`, `trace_id`) that persists across every hop of a multi-step pipeline once a step claims it with `baggage`. Carried in the `event_context` ledger and merged into downstream requests.

## Worker Pool (Max Workers)

The global set of execution slots that process jobs in parallel. Controlled by `service.max_workers` (defaults to `CPU-1`).

## Parallelism

The maximum number of concurrent jobs allowed for a specific plugin or alias. Prevents a single resource-heavy plugin from saturating the worker pool.

## Concurrency Safe

A boolean hint in a plugin's `manifest.yaml`. If false (default), the plugin is restricted to a parallelism of 1 (serial execution) to prevent race conditions.

## Smart Dequeue

The logic that skips jobs in the queue if their target plugin has already reached its parallelism limit, allowing other plugins to proceed.

## Result

The human-readable summary or data returned by a plugin in its protocol response. Often used as the input for the next step in a pipeline.

## Plugin Facts

The append-only record of durable plugin observations. Each row carries a
stable snapshot a plugin emitted as `state_updates`, plus a manifest-declared
`fact_type` and a Ductile-owned monotonic `seq`. This is the durable record
of what a plugin remembers across runs. See [PLUGIN_FACTS.md](./PLUGIN_FACTS.md).

## Plugin State (Compatibility View)

A single JSON row per plugin maintained as the compatibility/cache view of
the latest fact. Existing readers (and protocol-v2 plugins that have not yet
declared `fact_outputs`) see the same shape they always have. The view is
rebuilt automatically by core when a new fact lands. New plugins should
declare `fact_outputs` rather than treating this row as the place where
durable truth lives.

## Job

The atomic unit of work in Ductile. Every command invocation creates an immutable Job record capturing input, output, logs, and status.

## Queue

The persistent, SQLite-backed job queue. All triggers (scheduler, router, API, webhooks) submit jobs here for the worker pool to pick up.

## Schedule

A configuration entry that tells the scheduler when and how to run a plugin command (e.g., `every: 5m`, `cron: "0 * * * *"`).

## Jitter

A random offset applied to schedules to prevent multiple jobs from triggering at the exact same millisecond (the "thundering herd" problem).

## Dedupe Key

A unique string used to suppress duplicate enqueues. If a job with the same key is already queued or recently succeeded, the new enqueue is ignored.

## Circuit Breaker

An automated safety switch that "opens" after repeated plugin failures, temporarily blocking scheduled runs to allow the system or external API to recover.

## Webhook

An HMAC-verified HTTP endpoint that accepts external events and injects them into the Ductile event bus.

## Skill

A machine-readable description of a capability (either an atomic plugin command or an orchestrated pipeline), exported via `/skills` or `/openapi.json`.

## Workspace (historical)

Formerly: a per-job, hard-link-cloned directory the core provisioned
for each plugin invocation. Removed in Sprint 18; the core no longer
touches the filesystem on a job's behalf. Plugins that need a scratch
path manage it themselves.

## Execution Ledger

The persistent history of all jobs, pipeline steps, and event transitions. Used for the TUI "Overwatch" and audit logging.
