# Ductile: Database Reference

Ductile uses **SQLite 3** for all persistent state, job queuing, and execution history. This document provides the schema definitions and a collection of useful queries for operators.

---

## Database Location
The database is typically named `ductile.db` and resides in your configured `state.path` (default: `~/.config/ductile/ductile.db`).

---

## Schema Overview

### 1. `job_queue`
The active work queue. Contains pending, running, and recently completed jobs.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique job identifier. |
| `status` | TEXT | `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `timed_out`, `dead`. |
| `plugin` | TEXT | Name of the plugin or alias. |
| `command` | TEXT | The plugin command (e.g., `poll`, `handle`). |
| `payload` | JSON | Input data for the plugin. |
| `dedupe_key` | TEXT | Used to prevent duplicate enqueues. |
| `event_context_id`| UUID | Reference to the baggage/context for this job. |

### 2. `job_log`
The historical record of completed jobs. Used for auditing and the TUI "Overwatch."

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `result` | JSON | The full protocol response from the plugin. |
| `stderr` | TEXT | Captured stderr (capped at 64 KB). |
| `last_error` | TEXT | Human-readable error message if the job failed. |

### 3. `event_context`
The "Control Plane" ledger. Stores metadata (Baggage) that propagates through pipelines.

### 4. `plugin_state`
Persistent key-value store for plugins (e.g., OAuth tokens, cursors).

### 5. `schedule_entries`
The persistent state of the scheduler. Tracks when each schedule last fired and when it is due next.

### 6. `circuit_breakers`
Tracks consecutive failures for scheduled polls.

---

## Useful Operator Queries

### System Health
```sql
-- Count jobs by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) 
FROM job_queue 
GROUP BY status;

-- Identify plugins with active circuit breakers
SELECT plugin, command, state, failure_count, opened_at 
FROM circuit_breakers 
WHERE state != 'closed';

-- Check for stuck "running" jobs (orphans)
SELECT id, plugin, command, started_at 
FROM job_queue 
WHERE status = 'running' 
  AND started_at < datetime('now', '-1 hour');
```

### Performance & Troubleshooting
```sql
-- Find the slowest successful jobs in the last 24 hours
SELECT plugin, command, 
       (strftime('%s', completed_at) - strftime('%s', started_at)) as duration_sec
FROM job_log
WHERE status = 'succeeded'
  AND completed_at > datetime('now', '-1 day')
ORDER BY duration_sec DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Get the latest error for a specific plugin
SELECT completed_at, last_error, stderr
FROM job_log
WHERE plugin = 'my-plugin' AND status = 'failed'
ORDER BY completed_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Inspect a plugin's persistent state
SELECT state FROM plugin_state WHERE plugin_name = 'my-plugin';
```

### Scheduler Inspection
```sql
-- See upcoming scheduled runs
SELECT plugin, schedule_id, next_run_at, last_success_at
FROM schedule_entries
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY next_run_at ASC;
```

## Maintenance

### Manual Cleanup
Ductile automatically prunes `job_log` after 30 days, but you can manually vacuum or prune if needed:
```bash
# Prune logs older than 7 days
sqlite3 ductile.db "DELETE FROM job_log WHERE completed_at < datetime('now', '-7 days');"

# Reclaim disk space
sqlite3 ductile.db "VACUUM;"
```

### Performance Tuning
Ductile enables **WAL mode** and **Synchronous=NORMAL** by default for optimal performance on SSDs. You can verify this via:
```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode;
PRAGMA synchronous;
```
