# Ductile — Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Author:** Matt Joyce
**Sources:** RFC-001, RFC-002, RFC-002-Decisions

This is the unified, buildable specification for Ductile. It supersedes all prior RFCs and review documents.

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Problem

Ductile currently exists as a FastAPI monolith handling health data ETL, LLM processing, and various integrations. Adding new connectors means modifying the core application. Existing integration servers (n8n, Huginn, Node-RED) are too heavy for a personal service.

### 1.2 Solution

A lightweight, YAML-configured, modular integration gateway. A compiled Go core orchestrates polyglot plugins via a subprocess protocol. Simple enough to understand in an afternoon. Extensible enough to grow with new connectors.

### 1.3 Scope

This is a **personal integration server** processing roughly 50 jobs per day. Design decisions are calibrated to that scale. The system runs unattended and must behave predictably under crash, retry, and timeout conditions.

### 2.1 Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Core language | Go | Single binary, easy deployment, natural subprocess spawning |
| Plugin coupling | Subprocess (JSON over stdin/stdout) | Language-agnostic, fault-isolated, drop-in plugins |
| Scheduling | Heartbeat with fuzzy intervals | Human-friendly, avoids thundering herd |
| Execution | Serial FIFO dispatch | Simple, predictable, no concurrency bugs |
| Routing | Config-declared, fan-out, exact match | Plugins stay dumb, core controls flow |
| Pipeline Execution | Async by default; Sync opt-in | Preserves event-driven core while enabling interactive results |
| State | SQLite | Proven, zero-ops, single JSON blob per plugin |
| Delivery | At-least-once | Plugins own idempotency; core never drops work |
| Plugin lifecycle | Spawn-per-command | Eliminates daemon management, memory leaks, zombie processes |

### 2.2 Governance Hybrid (The "Control vs. Data Plane")

Ductile employs a "Governance Hybrid" model to manage state and data across multi-hop plugin chains.

*   **Control Plane (Baggage):** Metadata about the execution (e.g., `origin_user_id`, `trace_id`). This data is stored in the `event_context` SQLite ledger and is automatically merged and carried forward as "Baggage" to every subsequent job in the chain. Keys starting with `origin_` are immutable.
*   **Data Plane (Workspaces):** Large physical artifacts (e.g., audio files, documents). Every job is assigned a unique `workspace_dir` on the filesystem. When a pipeline branches, Ductile performs a **Zero-Copy Clone** (using hardlinks) to isolate workspaces while saving disk space.

---

## 3. Work Queue

The central abstraction. All producers submit to a single queue.

### 3.1 Producers

| Producer | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| Scheduler | Heartbeat tick finds a plugin is due |
| Webhook receiver | Inbound HTTP event |
| Router | Plugin output matches a routing rule |
| CLI | Manual `ductile run <plugin>` |

### 3.2 Job Model

```
{
  id:              UUID
  plugin:          string
  command:         string (poll | handle)
  payload:         JSON
  status:          queued | running | succeeded | failed | timed_out | dead
  attempt:         int (starts at 1)
  max_attempts:    int (default 4)
  submitted_by:    string (scheduler | webhook | route | cli)
  dedupe_key:      string (optional)
  created_at:      timestamp
  started_at:      timestamp (null until running)
  completed_at:    timestamp (null until terminal)
  next_retry_at:   timestamp (null unless awaiting retry)
  last_error:      text (null unless failed)
  parent_job_id:   UUID (null unless created by routing)
  source_event_id: UUID (null unless created by routing)
}
```

No `priority` field. Jobs are strictly FIFO.

### 3.3 Job State Machine

```
queued → running → succeeded
                 → failed → queued (retry)
                          → dead (max retries exceeded)
         → timed_out → queued (retry)
                     → dead (max retries exceeded)
```

### 3.4 Delivery Guarantee

**At-least-once.** A job may run more than once (after crash, timeout, or retry). It will never be silently dropped.

- Plugins MUST be idempotent, or use `state` to track what they've already processed.
- The core provides an opt-in `dedupe_key` field. If a job is enqueued with a `dedupe_key` matching a job that succeeded within the effective dedupe window, it is not enqueued. The drop is logged at `INFO` with the `dedupe_key` and existing job ID.
- `dedupe_ttl` is configurable (default 24h) and acts as the default dedupe window. Callers may set a per-enqueue dedupe TTL override when a narrower window is needed (for example, scheduler cadence). When this override is set, enqueue also guards against in-flight duplicates (`queued`/`running`) for that `dedupe_key`.

### 3.5 Dispatch

**Serial, single lane.** One job at a time, FIFO. No priority lanes. No concurrency.

Revisit condition: daily job count exceeds 500, or median queue wait time exceeds 30 seconds — with data to back it up.

### 3.6 Deduplication

When a producer enqueues a job with a `dedupe_key`:

1. Determine effective dedupe TTL: per-enqueue override (if provided), otherwise service `dedupe_ttl`.
2. If a per-enqueue override is set, query for an existing `queued` or `running` job with the same `dedupe_key`.
3. Query for a `succeeded` job with the same `dedupe_key` completed within the effective TTL.
4. If either check finds a match: do not enqueue. Log at `INFO`: dedupe_key, existing job ID.
5. If no match is found: enqueue normally.

---

## 4. Scheduler

A single internal tick loop manages scheduled `poll` jobs. Each enabled plugin can define one or more schedule entries under `schedules:`. Plugins without schedules are ignored by the scheduler and can still be triggered via webhook, router, CLI, or API.

### 4.1 Schedule Entries

Each schedule entry is independent and has its own ID (default: `default`), command, and payload:

```yaml
plugins:
  withings:
    schedules:
      - id: hourly
        every: 1h
        command: poll
        payload:
          source: heartbeat
```

Supported schedule types:
- `every`: Interval schedule (`5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `hourly`, `2h`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`).
- `cron`: Standard 5-field cron (`min hour dom month dow`).
- `at`: One-shot RFC3339 timestamp.
- `after`: One-shot delay from service start.

### 4.2 Time Controls

Schedule execution can be constrained with time settings:
- `jitter`: Random offset per scheduled run.
- `preferred_window`: Hard window (`start`, `end`) for interval schedules.
- `only_between`: Time window string (e.g. `"08:00-22:00"`).
- `timezone`: IANA timezone for cron/window evaluation.
- `not_on`: List of weekdays to skip (`[saturday, sunday]` or `[0-6]`).

Jitter is computed per scheduled run (not per tick):
```
next_run = last_successful_run + interval + random(-jitter/2, +jitter/2)
```

### 4.3 Catch-up and Overlap

Two per-schedule policies control missed ticks and concurrency:
- `catch_up`: `skip` (default), `run_once`, `run_all`.
- `if_running`: `skip` (default), `queue`, `cancel`.

### 4.4 Poll Guard

The scheduler **must not enqueue** a new `poll` job if there is already a `queued` or `running` `poll` job for that plugin. Configurable per-plugin (default 1):

```yaml
plugins:
  withings:
    max_outstanding_polls: 1
```

---

## 5. Plugin System

### 5.1 Lifecycle: Spawn-Per-Command

One process per job. No long-lived plugin processes.

1. Fork the plugin entrypoint.
2. Write JSON request to stdin.
3. Close stdin.
4. Read stdout until EOF or timeout.
5. Capture stderr.
6. Collect exit code.
7. Kill the process if it hasn't exited.

Process spawn overhead is ~5ms on Linux — irrelevant when the shortest interval is 5 minutes.

**Persistent connections (WebSockets, long-polling) are out of scope.** If needed, run as a separate service that pushes events into Ductile via the webhook endpoint. No streaming plugin mode — not now, not ever for this core.

### 5.2 Commands

| Command | Purpose | When |
|---------|---------|------|
| `poll` | Fetch data from external source | Scheduled by heartbeat |
| `handle` | Process an inbound event | Routed from another plugin or webhook |
| `health` | Diagnostic check | On-demand via `ductile status` |
| `init` | One-time setup | On first discovery or config change |

- `init` is not retried on failure — plugin is marked unhealthy.
- `health` is not called on a schedule — it's a diagnostic tool for the operator.

### 5.3 Plugin Directory Structure

```
plugins/
├── withings/
│   ├── manifest.yaml
│   └── run.py
├── google-calendar/
│   ├── manifest.yaml
│   └── run.py
├── notify/
│   ├── manifest.yaml
│   └── run.sh
└── lib/            # shared helpers (e.g. OAuth utilities)
```

### 5.4 Manifest

**Object format:**
```yaml
manifest_spec: ductile.plugin
manifest_version: 1
name: withings
version: 1.0.0
protocol: 1
entrypoint: run.py
description: "Fetch health data from Withings API"
commands:
  poll:
    type: read
    description: "Fetch latest measurements from Withings API"
  sync:
    type: write
    description: "Push weight data to Withings API"
  oauth_callback:
    type: write
    description: "Handle OAuth2 callback and store tokens"
  health:
    type: read
    description: "Health check"
config_keys:
  required: [client_id, client_secret]
  optional: [access_token]
```

**Command type semantics (Sprint 3+):**
- `type: read` - No external side effects, idempotent (safe for automated retries)
  - Examples: poll, fetch, get, list, health
  - Can update local plugin state (e.g., cache, timestamps)
  - Cannot POST/PUT/DELETE to external APIs
- `type: write` - Modifies external state, may not be idempotent
  - Examples: sync, send, notify, oauth_callback, delete
  - Default if type not specified (paranoid default)

**Purpose:** Enables manifest-driven token scopes (`plugin:ro` vs `plugin:rw`) without hardcoding command knowledge in auth middleware.

**Validation:**
- `manifest_spec` — must be `ductile.plugin`.
- `manifest_version` — must be `1`.
- `protocol` — must match a version the core supports. Mismatch → plugin not loaded.
- `entrypoint` — mandatory. Core constructs execution path relative to the discovered plugin directory.
- `config_keys.required` — validated at load time. Missing keys → plugin not loaded, error logged.
- `commands.*.type` — must be `read` or `write` if specified. Invalid type → plugin not loaded.

See card #36 (Manifest Command Type Metadata).

### 5.5 Trust & Execution

- Plugins MUST live under one of the configured plugin roots. Symlinks resolved, must resolve within an approved root.
- `..` in `entrypoint` is rejected (path traversal prevention).
- Entrypoint MUST be executable (`chmod +x`). Shebang line handles interpreter selection.
- World-writable plugin directories are refused at load time.
- Plugins run as the same OS user as the core. Use systemd `User=ductile` to limit blast radius.

### 5.6 Timeouts

**Defaults:**

| Command | Timeout |
|---------|---------|
| `poll` | 60s |
| `handle` | 120s |
| `health` | 10s |
| `init` | 30s |

**Enforcement:**

1. Core starts a deadline timer when spawning the process.
2. On timeout: `SIGTERM` to the process group.
3. 5-second grace period.
4. `SIGKILL` if still alive.
5. Job status → `timed_out`, follows retry policy.

**Configurable per-plugin:**

```yaml
plugins:
  slow-plugin:
    timeouts:
      poll: 300s
      handle: 300s
```

**Resource caps:**
- Max stdout: 10 MB. Truncated with logged warning.
- Max stderr: 1 MB. Truncated.

### 5.7 Retry & Backoff

- Default: 4 attempts total (1 original + 3 retries).
- Backoff: `base * 2^(attempt-1) + random(0, base)` where `base = 30s`.
- Retry delays: ~30s, ~1m, ~2m (then dead).

**Non-retryable conditions:**
- Plugin exits with code `78` (EX_CONFIG from sysexits.h) — configuration error.
- Plugin response includes `"retry": false`.
- All other failures are retried.

**Configurable per-plugin:**

```yaml
plugins:
  withings:
    retry:
      max_attempts: 5
      backoff_base: 60s
```

### 5.8 Circuit Breaker

Configurable consecutive failure threshold per `(plugin, command)` pair. Applies to **scheduler-originated poll jobs only** — webhook-triggered `handle` jobs are not blocked by poll failures.

- Default threshold: 3 consecutive failures.
- Default reset: 30 minutes.
- Manual reset: `ductile system reset <plugin>`.
- States: `closed` -> `open` -> `half_open`.
- When cooldown expires, scheduler allows a single half-open probe poll:
  - Success closes the circuit and resets failure count.
  - Failure reopens the circuit.

```yaml
plugins:
  withings:
    circuit_breaker:
      threshold: 3
      reset_after: 30m
```

### 5.9 State Model

**Config is static. State is dynamic.**

- `config` — from `config.yaml`, interpolated with env vars, read-only. Contains credentials, endpoints — things the operator sets.
  - Config paths (config dir, includes, backups) are local operator-controlled inputs; Ductile does not accept untrusted remote file paths.
  - `service.allow_symlinks` controls whether symlinks are permitted in config/plugin paths (warnings are always emitted when symlinks are detected).
- `state` — single JSON blob per plugin in SQLite. Plugins read it, return `state_updates`, core applies shallow merge (top-level keys replaced, not deep-merged).

```sql
plugin_state (
  plugin_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  state       JSON NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  updated_at  TIMESTAMP
)
```

**Size limit:** 1 MB per plugin state blob. Exceeding this rejects the update and fails the job.

### 5.10 OAuth

Plugins manage their own OAuth token lifecycle. The core does not understand OAuth.

- `client_id`, `client_secret` → `config` (static, set by operator).
- `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `token_expiry` → `state` (dynamic, managed by plugin).
- Plugin checks expiry on each invocation, refreshes if needed, returns new tokens via `state_updates`.
- Shared OAuth helpers can live in `plugins/lib/`.

---

## 6. Protocol (v2)

### 6.1 Request Envelope (core → plugin)

Single JSON object written to plugin's stdin:

```json
{
  "protocol": 2,
  "job_id": "uuid",
  "command": "poll | handle | health | init",
  "config": {},
  "state": {},
  "context": {},
  "workspace_dir": "/path/to/workspace",
  "event": {},
  "deadline_at": "ISO8601"
}
```

- `event` — present only for `handle`.
- `state` — the plugin's full state blob.
- `context` — shared metadata (Baggage) carried across the pipeline chain.
- `workspace_dir` — local filesystem directory for ephemeral artifacts.
- `deadline_at` — informational. Plugins MAY use it to abandon long-running work early. The core enforces the real deadline externally.

### 6.2 Response Envelope (plugin → core)

Single JSON object written to plugin's stdout:

```json
{
  "status": "ok | error",
  "result": "short human-readable summary",
  "error": "human-readable message (when status=error)",
  "retry": true,
  "events": [],
  "state_updates": {},
  "logs": []
}
```

- `result` — required when `status=ok`. Summarizes what the plugin did.
- `retry` — defaults to `true` if omitted. Set `false` for permanent failures.
- `events` — array of event envelopes (see 6.3).
- `state_updates` — shallow-merged into plugin state.
- `logs` — array of `{"level": "info|warn|error", "message": "..."}`. Optional. Stored with the job record.

### 6.3 Event Envelope

Every event emitted by a plugin in the `events` array:

```json
{
  "type": "new_health_data",
  "payload": {},
  "dedupe_key": "withings:weight:2026-02-08"
}
```

- `type` — matches `event_type` in routing config. Exact string match.
- `payload` — arbitrary JSON, passed to downstream plugin's `handle` command.
- `dedupe_key` — optional. Downstream job inherits this as its `dedupe_key`.

The core injects when creating downstream jobs:
- `source` — plugin name.
- `timestamp` — ISO8601.
- `event_id` — UUID assigned by the core.

### 6.4 Framing

Single JSON object on stdout. Not JSON Lines, not length-prefixed. One request, one response, process exits.

### 6.5 Protocol Mismatch

If the request `protocol` field doesn't match what the plugin expects, the plugin SHOULD exit with code `78` (EX_CONFIG) and a clear error on stderr. The core refuses to load plugins whose manifest declares a `protocol` version it doesn't support.

---

## 7. Routing

Plugin chaining is declared in config, not by plugins. Plugins produce typed events; the config says where they go.

### 7.1 Config

```yaml
routes:
  - from: withings
    event_type: new_health_data
    to: health-analyzer

  - from: health-analyzer
    event_type: alert
    to: notify
```

### 7.2 Semantics

- **Fan-out:** A single event can match multiple routes. All matching routes produce a job.
- **No match:** Logged at DEBUG, dropped. Not an error.
- **Matching:** Exact string match on `event_type` only. No wildcards, no regexes, no glob patterns.
- **No conditional filters.** No `payload.severity == "high"`. If you need conditional logic, put it in the receiving plugin — it can inspect the payload and no-op.

### 7.3 Traceability

When the router creates a downstream job from an event:
- `parent_job_id` is set to the producing job's ID.
- `source_event_id` is set to the core-assigned `event_id`.

---

## 8. Pipelines (DSL)

Pipelines provide a higher-level orchestration layer over raw routes, using a GitHub Actions-inspired notation.

### 8.1 Schema

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: youtube-summary
    on: discord.command.youtube    # Trigger event type
    execution_mode: synchronous     # Optional: async | synchronous
    timeout: 3m                    # Optional: duration (default 30s)
    steps:
      - id: download               # Optional
        uses: youtube.download     # plugin.command
        
      - id: summarize
        uses: fabric.summarize
        
      - id: notify
        uses: discord.respond
```

### 8.2 Execution Modes

- **async (default):** Fire-and-forget. The API returns `202 Accepted` with a `job_id` immediately. Dispatcher handles jobs as they come.
- **synchronous (opt-in):** The API caller "stays on the line". The gateway waits for the entire execution tree (all steps) to reach a terminal state before responding with aggregated results.

### 8.3 Guarded Bridge

The engine remains event-driven and asynchronous internally. Synchronous behavior is implemented as a "Guarded Bridge" at the API layer:
1. Dispatcher provides completion channels for job trees.
2. API handler blocks on these channels.
3. If `timeout` is exceeded, the bridge "breaks" and returns `202 Accepted` with the root `job_id`, allowing the client to poll for completion.

---

## 9. API Endpoints

The HTTP API allows external systems (LLMs, scripts, other services) to programmatically trigger plugin execution and retrieve job results.

### 9.1 Configuration

```yaml
api:
  enabled: true
  listen: "localhost:8080"
  auth:
    tokens:
      - token: ${ADMIN_API_TOKEN}
        scopes: ["*"]
```

### 9.2 Primary Trigger Endpoints

The API exposes two first-class trigger paths:

- `POST /plugin/{plugin}/{command}`: direct plugin execution (no pipeline routing), returns `202 Accepted`.
- `POST /pipeline/{pipeline}`: explicit pipeline orchestration, returns `202 Accepted` by default and `200 OK` for synchronous pipelines.

See `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` for full examples and response schemas.

### 9.3 GET /job/{job_id}

Retrieves the status and results of a previously triggered job.

**Request:**
- URL param: `{job_id}` - UUID returned from one of the POST trigger endpoints
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Response (200 OK - queued):**
```json
{
  "job_id": "uuid-v4",
  "status": "queued",
  "plugin": "plugin_name",
  "command": "command_name",
  "created_at": "2026-02-09T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Response (200 OK - running):**
```json
{
  "job_id": "uuid-v4",
  "status": "running",
  "plugin": "plugin_name",
  "command": "command_name",
  "started_at": "2026-02-09T10:00:05Z"
}
```

**Response (200 OK - completed):**
```json
{
  "job_id": "uuid-v4",
  "status": "completed",
  "plugin": "plugin_name",
  "command": "command_name",
  "result": {
    "status": "ok",
    "result": "Plugin executed successfully",
    "state_updates": {"last_run": "2026-02-09T10:00:10Z"},
    "logs": [{"level": "info", "message": "Plugin executed successfully"}]
  },
  "started_at": "2026-02-09T10:00:05Z",
  "completed_at": "2026-02-09T10:00:10Z"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `401 Unauthorized` - Missing or invalid token
- `404 Not Found` - Job ID not found

### 9.4 Authentication & Authorization (Sprint 3+)

**Bearer token authentication** with scoped permissions.

**Token registry** (`tokens.yaml`):
- Multiple tokens with individual scope definitions
- Each token references a scope file (JSON)
- BLAKE3 hash ensures scope file integrity
- Environment variable references for keys (never plaintext)

**Scope types (current):**
- `plugin:ro`, `plugin:rw` - Plugin and pipeline trigger permissions
- `jobs:ro`, `jobs:rw` - Job read/write permissions
- `events:ro`, `events:rw` - Event stream permissions
- `*` - Full admin access

**Example tokens.yaml:**
```yaml
tokens:
  - name: admin-cli
    key: ${ADMIN_API_KEY}
    scopes_file: scopes/admin-cli.json
    scopes_hash: blake3:a3f8c2d9...

  - name: github-integration
    key: ${GITHUB_API_KEY}
    scopes_file: scopes/github-integration.json
    scopes_hash: blake3:b4e9d3c0...
```

**Example scope file (scopes/github-integration.json):**
```json
{
  "scopes": [
    "read:jobs",
    "read:events",
    "github-handler:rw",
    "withings:ro"
  ]
}
```

**Authorization middleware:**
1. Extract bearer token from `Authorization` header
2. Lookup token in registry
3. Load and verify scope file (BLAKE3 hash check)
4. Normalize implied read-from-write scopes
5. Check if requested action matches any granted scope
6. Return 403 if denied, proceed if allowed

Tokens should be stored in environment variables and interpolated (for example `${ADMIN_API_TOKEN}`).

- All API requests must include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Invalid or missing token returns `401 Unauthorized`
- No key rotation mechanism in MVP (manual config update + reload)

### 9.5 Resource Guarding (Synchronous Pipelines)

To prevent HTTP worker exhaustion, synchronous pipelines are governed by a semaphore:
- **api.max_concurrent_sync:** Max number of simultaneous blocking API calls (default 10).
- **api.max_sync_timeout:** Hard limit on pipeline timeout to prevent zombie connections.

### 9.6 Use Cases

- **LLM Tool Calling:** LLM agents can call `/plugin` for atomic actions and `/pipeline` for orchestrated workflows
- **External Automation:** Scripts, cron jobs, or other services can trigger plugins programmatically
- **Result Polling:** External systems can poll /job/{id} to wait for async plugin execution completion
- **Manual Testing:** Developers can trigger plugins via curl without waiting for scheduler

## 10. Webhooks

For operator setup and example requests, see [WEBHOOKS.md](WEBHOOKS.md).

### 10.1 Listener

```yaml
webhooks:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:8081
  endpoints:
    - path: /hook/github
      plugin: github-handler
      secret_ref: github_webhook_secret
      signature_header: X-Hub-Signature-256
      max_body_size: 1MB
```

### 10.2 Security

HMAC-SHA256 signature verification is **mandatory** for all webhook endpoints.

1. Read raw request body (up to `max_body_size`, default 1 MB).
2. Resolve `secret_ref` from tokens.yaml and compute `HMAC-SHA256(secret, raw_body)`.
3. Compare against the signature header (configurable name per endpoint).
4. Reject with `403` if invalid. No error details in response.
5. Reject with `413` if body exceeds `max_body_size`.

No replay protection in V1. No rate limiting in V1 (proxy responsibility if fronted by reverse proxy).

### 10.3 Health Endpoint

`/healthz` on the webhook listener port:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime_seconds": 3600,
  "queue_depth": 2,
  "plugins_loaded": 5,
  "plugins_circuit_open": 0
}
```

No authentication. Localhost only. Useful for systemd watchdog and operator checks.

## 11. Operations

### 11.1 Single-Instance Lock

PID file with `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)`:

1. Create/open `<state_dir>/ductile.lock`.
2. Acquire `flock`. Fail → log error, exit 1.
3. Write current PID.
4. Lock held for process lifetime. Kernel releases on crash/exit.

### 11.2 Crash Recovery

On startup:

1. Open the SQLite database.
2. Acquire the exclusive lock.
3. Find all jobs with `status = running` — orphans from a prior crash.
4. For each orphan: increment `attempt`, set `status = queued` if under `max_attempts`, else `status = dead`.
5. Log each recovered job at WARN level.
6. Resume normal dispatch.

### 11.3 Config Reload

Send `SIGHUP` to the running process (found via PID file) to reload config.

On SIGHUP:

1. Parse new config. If invalid → log error, keep old config.
2. In-flight jobs continue with existing config snapshot.
3. Scheduler updates intervals/jitter for all plugins.
4. Router updates routing rules.
5. Plugin config changes take effect on next dispatch.
6. Newly added plugins discovered → `init` runs.
7. Removed/disabled plugins → queued jobs cancelled (status → `dead`), no new jobs enqueued.

### 11.4 Logging

**Core logs:** JSON to stdout.

Fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `component`, `plugin` (when relevant), `job_id` (when relevant), `message`.

**Plugin stderr:** Captured. Always. Stored in `job_log` (capped at 64 KB). Logged at WARN to core log stream.

**Plugin stdout:** Reserved exclusively for protocol response. Stored verbatim on completion in `job_log.result` (JSON). Non-JSON on stdout is a protocol error — job fails, stderr + stdout captured for debugging.

**Redaction:** Not in V1. Don't log secrets. Fix the plugin, don't bandage the core.

### 11.5 Job Log Retention

Pruned on every scheduler tick:

```sql
DELETE FROM job_log WHERE completed_at < datetime('now', '-30 days')
```

Default 30 days. Configurable via `service.job_log_retention`.

### 11.6 CLI

```
ductile system start       # run the service (foreground)
ductile run <plugin>       # manually run a plugin once
ductile status             # show plugin states, queue depth, last runs
# send SIGHUP to reload config without restart
ductile system reset <plugin>     # reset circuit breaker for a plugin
ductile plugins            # list discovered plugins
ductile logs [plugin]      # tail structured logs
ductile queue              # show pending/active jobs
```

### 11.7 CLI Principles

To ensure predictability and safety for both human and LLM operators, all CLI commands MUST adhere to the standards defined in `docs/CLI_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`.

Core requirements:
- **Hierarchy:** Strict **NOUN ACTION** pattern.
- **Verbosity:** mandatory `-v` / `--verbose` flags.
- **Safety:** mandatory `--dry-run` for mutations.
- **Machine-Readability:** mandatory `--json` for status and inspection.

## 13. Configuration Reference

Ductile uses a **Monolithic Runtime** compiled from a modular, **Tiered Directory** structure.

### 13.1 Overview

For the complete configuration specification, including file formats, merge logic, and integrity verification rules, see:  
👉 **[docs/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md](CONFIG_REFERENCE.md)**

### 13.2 Key Principles

- **Directory-Based Modularity:** Configuration is split into `config.yaml`, `webhooks.yaml`, `tokens.yaml`, and modular directories for `plugins/` and `pipelines/`.
- **Multi-Root Plugin Discovery:** `plugin_roots` is the source of truth; roots are scanned in order and first match wins on duplicate plugin names.
- **Pipeline Discovery Flow:** Pipelines are loaded from both `pipelines/*.yaml` (alphabetical) and optional top-level `pipelines.yaml`.
- **Tiered Integrity:** High-security files (auth/webhooks) require a valid BLAKE3 hash in `.checksums` to start. Operational files (settings/pipelines) log warnings if hashes are missing or mismatched.
- **Monolithic Grafting:** At runtime, all discovered files are merged into a single internal configuration object following strict precedence rules (later entries override earlier ones).
- **Environment Interpolation:** Secrets are injected via `${VAR}` placeholders, which are interpolated after hash verification but before parsing.
- **Default Permissions:** Config directories and workspaces are created with `0700`. Config files and lock files default to `0600`; operators may relax permissions explicitly for shared environments.
- **Secret Redaction:** CLI config inspection outputs redact token keys and webhook secrets; secrets are only shown at creation time.

## 14. Deployment

### 14.1 Systemd Unit

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Ductile
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ductile system start --config /etc/ductile/config.yaml
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
Restart=on-failure
User=ductile
Group=ductile

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### 14.2 Development

Run `ductile system start` directly. No systemd required.

## 16. Implementation Phases

| Phase | Sprint | Scope | Status |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1. Skeleton | 0 | Go scaffold, CLI, config loader, SQLite state, plugin discovery | ✅ Complete |
| 2. Core Loop | 1 | Work queue, heartbeat scheduler with fuzzy intervals, dispatch loop, plugin protocol, crash recovery | ✅ Complete |
| 3. API Triggers | 2 | HTTP server with chi router, POST /plugin and POST /pipeline, GET /job, Bearer token auth, job result storage | ✅ Complete |
| 4. Routing | 3 | Config-declared event routing, downstream enqueuing, event_id traceability | ✅ Complete |
| 5. Webhooks | 3 | HTTP listener, HMAC verification, /healthz, route inbound webhooks to plugins | ✅ Complete |
| 6. Reliability Controls | 4 | Circuit breaker, retry with exponential backoff, deduplication enforcement | ✅ Complete |
| 7. Pipeline Orchestration | 4 | Sync/Async execution modes, Guarded Bridge, YAML DSL, completion channels | ✅ Complete |
| 8. CLI & Ops | 5 | Status/run/reload/reset/plugins/queue/logs commands, systemd unit | 🔄 In Progress (Status: ✅ Status implemented) |
| 9. First Plugins | 6 | Port Withings & Garmin from existing Ductile, notify plugin | Planned |

**Note:** Phase 3 (API Triggers) was prioritized before Routing and Webhooks to enable LLM-driven automation via curl-based triggers. This allows external systems to programmatically enqueue jobs and retrieve results immediately, accelerating the path to production use cases.

## 17. Deferred Decisions

| Topic | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| Two-tier stderr/stdout caps (capture vs persistence) | Current spec is workable. Clarify post-V1 if storage becomes a concern. |
| `protocol` field in response envelope | Can be added in protocol v2 without breaking v1 plugins. |
| Replay protection for webhooks | Provider-specific. Add per-plugin if a provider requires it. |
| Rate limiting on webhook listener | Proxy responsibility. Core doesn't duplicate concerns it can't own. |
| Secret redaction in logs | Operator responsibility. Fix the plugin, don't bandage the core. |
| Streaming / long-lived plugin mode | Out of scope permanently. If it needs to stream, it's not a plugin. |
| Priority queues / multi-lane dispatch | Revisit only if daily jobs exceed 500 or median wait exceeds 30s. |
| Router query language / payload filters | Put conditional logic in the receiving plugin. |
